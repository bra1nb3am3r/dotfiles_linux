fvwm (a small and fast virtual window manager for X)

Fvwm is the classic highly-configurable virtual window manager for
X11.  It is a derivative of twm, redesigned to minimize memory
consumption, provide a 3-D look to window frames, and provide a simple
virtual desktop.

This is the development version of fvwm, and build with libstroke from
SBo/libraries.

A translucent-menu patch is applied to this version too, which is stolen
from Gentoo.
