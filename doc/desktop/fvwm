= Commands =
== The virtual desktop ==
 * DesktopName desk name
   * This name is used in the WindowList command and in the FvwmPager where it
   * override the Label config option. Moreover, if consecutive names starting
   * from desktop 0 are defined, then these names can be used by any EWMH
   * compliant application (as a pager).
 * DeskTopSize HorizontalxVertical
   * Defines the virtual desktop size in units of the physical screen size.
 * EdgeResistance scrolling moving [xinerama-moving]
   *
 * EdgeScroll horizontal[p] vertical[p] [wrap|wrapx|wrapy]
   * Specifies the percentage of a page to scroll when the cursor hits the
   * edge of a page. A trailing 'p' changes the interpretation to mean pixels.
 * EdgeThickness 0|1|2
   * This is the width or height of the invisible window that fvwm creates on
   * the edges of the screen that are used for the edge scrolling feature.
   * A value of '0' completely disables mouse edge scrolling, even while
   * dragging a window. '1' gives the smallest pan frames, which seem to work
   * best except on some servers. '2' is the default.
 * EwmhBaseStruts left right top bottom
   * Where left, right, top and bottom are positive or null integers which
   * define bands at the edge of the screen. 
   * This is used to compute the Working Area.
 * GotoDesk prev | arg1 [arg2] [min max]
   * Switches the current viewport to another desktop (workspace, room).
   * The number of active desktops is determined dynamically. Only desktops
   * which contain windows or are currently being displayed are active.
 * GotoDeskAndPage prev | desk xpage ypage
   * Switches the current viewport to another desktop and page. The new desk
   * is 'desk' and the new page is (xpage,ypage).
 * GotoPage prev | [options] x [p] y [p]
   * Moves the desktop viewport to page (x,y).
 * Scroll horizonal [p] vertical [p]
   * Scrolls the virtual desktop's viewport by 'horizontal' pages in the
   * x-direction and the 'vertical' pages in the y-direction. (percent)
 *
== Window movement and placement ==
 * MoveThreshold [pixels]
   * When the user presses a mouse button upon an object fvwm waits to see if
   * the action is a click or a drag. If the mouse moves by more than pixels
   * pixels it is assumed to be a drag.
 *

== Style ==
=== Focus policy ===
=== Font names and font loading ===
 * the Font and IconFont Style
 * the Font MenuStyle
 * the DefaultFont commands

= Modules =
 * FvwmEvent
   * a module which allows listening for various events, and acting upon them
     when they occur
   * FvwmEvent: conditional window checking by example:
     http://linuxgazette.net/127/adam1.html
 * FvwmButtons
   * provides a window of buttons which sits on the X  terminal's root window.
