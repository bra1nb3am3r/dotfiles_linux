= main =
 1. Power on, the computer load the boot loader;
 2. Boot loader load the kernel and the initrd, then run the kernel;
 3. Kernel sets up the hardware, and give the control to /sbin/init;
 4. /sbin/init run boot time scipts according /etc/inittab, then invokes
    /sbin/getty;
 5. /sbin/getty sets terminal mode, speed, and conditions port, then invokes
    /bin/login for users logging in;
 6. /bin/login promats the user for password and validates it. If pass, get
    the user a shell.

= /etc/inittab =
 * id:runlevels:action:process
 * actions
   * respawn - The process will be restarted whenever it terminates.
   * wait - The process will be started once when the specified runlevel is
     entered and  init  will wait for its termination.
   * once - The process will be executed once when the specified runlevel is
     entered.
   * boot - The process will be executed during system boot.  The runlevels
     field is ignored.
   * off - This does nothing.
   * initdefault - An initdefault entry specifies the runlevel which should be
     entered after system  boot. If  none  exists,  init  will  ask  for a
     runlevel on the console. The process field is ignored.
   * sysinit - The process will be executed during system boot. It will be
     executed before any boot or bootwait entries.  The runlevels field is
     ignored.
   * ctrlaltdel - The process will be executed when init receives the SIGINT
     signal. This  means  that someone  on  the system console has pressed
     the CTRL-ALT-DEL key combination. Typically one wants to execute some
     sort of shutdown either to get into single-user level  or  to reboot the
     machine.

= getty =
 1. Open the tty port (usually a serial port) and condition the port (by
    setting its modes);
 O. Optionally uses an alternate /etc/issue file, or does not issue a login
    banner;
 2. Print the login prompt, and get the user's name;
 3. Initiate a login process for the user (which prompts the user for the
    password and validates it).
