= Document =
 * Filesystems (ext3, reiser, xfs, jfs) comparison on Debian Etch:
   http://www.debian-administration.org/articles/388

= YAFFS =
 * Yet Another Flash File System
 * Documnets:
   * Introducing YAFFS, the first NAND-specific flash file system:
     http://linuxdevices.com/articles/AT9680239525.html

= Cramfs =
 * Compressed ROM filesystem
 * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cramfs

= Ext3 =
 * 稳定，中庸

= JFFS2 =
 * Journaling Flash File System 2
 * Provides a fs directly on Flash, instead of emulating a block device
 * Resides on NOR and NAND Flash ROM chips
 * Performs wear-leveling to extend Flash file by ensuring equal write
   commands across the Flash bocks
 * Stores the Flash directory structure in RAM at all times
 * Implements a log-structured filesystem

= JFS =
 * JFS is the lowest CPU-usage FS

= ReiserFS =
 * It's the only filesystem that supports shrinking a filesystem now.
 * Nothing here will shake my own choice of ReiserFS for most general purpose
   filesystems, it has a good performance on real world benchmarks, and is the
   most mature of the journalling file systems presented.(simonw)

= XFS =
 * Sillion Graphic Inc.
 * Technical Specifications:
   * Journaled 64-bit filesystem with guaranteed filesystem consistency.
   * Online Administration: XFS supports filesystem growth for mounted
     volumes, allows filesystem "freeze" and "thaw" operations to support
     volume level snapshots, and provides an online file defragmentation
     utility.
   * Quotas: XFS supports user and group quotas. XFS considers quota
     information as filesystem metadata and uses journaling to avoid the need
     for lengthy quota consistency checks after a crash. 
   * XFS supports the ACL semantics and interfaces described in the draft
     POSIX 1003.1e standard.
 * XFS appears to be the most appropriate filesystem to install on a file
   server for home or small-business needs :
    * It uses the maximum capacity of your server hard disk(s)
    * It's the quickest FS to create, mount and unmount
    * It's the quickest FS for operations on large files (>500MB)
    * This FS gets a good place for operations on a large number of small to
      moderate-size files and directories
    * It constitutes a good CPU vs time compromise for large directory listing
      or file search

= YAFFS =
 * Yet Another Flash File System
 * designed and optimized for NAND Flash chips
 * larger Flash size and faster erase and write processes
 * journaling support that autonotically provides automatic wear-leveling and
   power-failure recovery
 * scalability that reduces RAM usages and provides faster boot times
